# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game 

I'm currently studying JavaScript through an online course on the Super Simple Dev YouTube channel, and one of the projects I built while learning was this Rock, Paper, Scissors game! ðŸŽ®

Itâ€™s a simple game, but it helped me practice key concepts like event handling, DOM manipulation, and local storage.
